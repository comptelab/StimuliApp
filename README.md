#  README

StimuliApp is a free app designed to create psychophysical tests with precise timing on iOS and iPadOS devices.

With a simple system of menus, you can design and run tests to assess perceptual capabilities, right on your iPad or iPhone.
Programming skills are not necessary.

You can easily create the most common stimuli (gabors, random dots, images, sounds and videos among others).


## Features
- Precise timing (frames are not dropped) due to the use of the Metal framework, which provides direct access to the GPU of the device.
- Option to run tests at 60 or 120 Hz depending on the device model.
- Perfectly synchronized visual and auditory stimulation.
- Interactive creation of stimuli using real-time preview.
- Possibility of using different spatial and time units.
- Gamma-correction features.
- Automatic report generation.
- Exportable tests that can be shared with other devices.
